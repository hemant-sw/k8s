What is infrastructure as code ?
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations.

Benefits of Iac ?
- Cost reduction
- Increase in speed of deployments
- Reduce errors 
- Improve infrastructure consistency
- Eliminate configuration drift

Iac tools -
- Terraform.
- Ansible.
- AWS CloudFormation.
- Azure Resource Manager.
- Google Cloud Deployment Manager.
- Chef.
- Puppet.
- SaltStack.

What Is AWS CloudFormation?
- AWS CloudFormation is an AWS service that uses template files to automate the setup of AWS resources.
- It can also be described as infrastructure automation or Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool and a cloud automation solution because it can automate the setup and deployment of various Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings on the AWS CloudFormation supports virtually every service that runs in AWS. (A full list of supported services is available here.)
- You can use CloudFormation to automate the configuration of workloads that run on the most popular AWS services, like the EC2 compute service, the S3 storage service, and the IAM service for configuring access control.

what are Third-party Iac tools ?
 
- The main advantage of choosing an alternative to CloudFormation is that most third-party IaC tools can configure resources running on various public clouds, not just AWS. If you use multiple clouds at once -- in other words, if you run some workloads on AWS and others on Microsoft Azure -- a third-party IaC tool platform is convenient because it allows you to use the same configuration management tool for all of your workloads.
- On the other hand, as AWS's native IaC platform, CloudFormation offers the deepest level of integration with the AWS cloud, including features like Designer, which lets you create and modify CloudFormation templates directly on the AWS website.
