<h2>Jenkins</h2> 

<h3>Jenkins is one of the most popular automation tool used worldwide for continuous integration and continuous delivery.
Jenkins is a free and open-source automation server that enables developers to build, integrate, and test code automatically as soon as it is committed to the source repository.</h3>

<h2>Continuous Integration</h2> 
<h3>Continuous Integration is a process in which the code is merged from multiple contributors and added to a singlerepository.
In simple words, CI is a process to take the code package it and send it to the CD for further processing.</h3>

<h2>Continuous delivery/deployment</h2> 
<h3>The basic difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment is that in Continuous Delivery to deploy the code after the CI process you have to manually trigger it via some button to deploy on the
system whereas in Continuous Deployment this process is automatic.</h3>
